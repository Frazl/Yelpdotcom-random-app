Ever get so bored you decide to make an express / nodejs server and then a reactjs app to compliment it to pull stuff from the yelp API? Well one day I did 

# What is this?

This was a simple project as I wanted to get around the issue of 'Access-Control-Allow-Origins' which wouldn't let me pull stuff directly from the Yelp API using javascript. 

It's moreso two projects and hence why they have separate read me(s) :)
